About me

I'm a PhD Fellow at the Department of Business Humanities and Law at Copenhagen Business School. My PhD research will focus on the political economy of capitalism, investment, regulation, and law, and specifically how the scope of state action is transformed, restricted, and governed by entrepreneurial logics. Using Entrepreneurialism as symptom of - and lens through which to view - contemporary capitalism, I hope to understand (1) the construction of European financial infrastructure and (2) how this infrastructure shapes state investment capabilities. While a political scientist by training, I approach research from an interdisciplinary standpoint, borrowing from sociology, law, philosophy, economics, and history.

I hold a BA (Cum Laude) and an MPP (Summa Cum Laude) from Sciences Po Paris, and my professional experience includes positions at Accenture, the European Commission, and the OECD. I'm a recipient of the Swedish-French Association academic scholarship, and I was selected as winner of the Humanities & Social Science Category of the Swedish 2023 Nova 111 Student List.
